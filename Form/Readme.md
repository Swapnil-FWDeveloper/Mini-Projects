
This is the very basic form with all basic functionality

1 Here I have used method="post" because whenever the user submit data so his all the data will not be seen on tab so that
it will prevent privacy and it will good also.
2 I have used here input "type" (The value attribute) so that user will get to know what type of data to enter
3 "required" it specifies that an input field must be filled out before submitting the form
4  Also I have used id and class to some input and some other tag so that it helps to lay out your code in a well structured format.
5 The <fieldset> tag is used to group related elements in a form.
6 The <legend> tag also supports the Global Attributes in HTML.

So the tag which I have used here is 
 1 form.
 2 select
 3 fieldset
 4 legend
 5 input
 6 div
 7 h1,h2
 7 p
 8 a
 9 br
