 Here their are multiple properties of Css Like :
 
   1=> background-image: url('./plady.jpg');
    /* By this property we can add img to a file */

   2=> background-repeat: no-repeat;
    /* The background-repeat property sets if/how a background image will be repeated. */

   3=> position: sticky;
       top: 0px;
    /* Ny this two Position and top Property navbar will not move only img will move */
    

   4=> display: inline-block;
    /* By this Property we div will be incline in header and also it will be block */
  
   5=> position:absolute;
    /* it allow element to be in right corner of a block */
